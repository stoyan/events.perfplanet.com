## Why Local Profiling Isnâ€™t Enough: Profiling End Users

The Chrome Devtools is our bread and butter but we may be leaning on it too much when fixing production performance issues. You get a user complaint about performance and you spin up chrome devtools and try to reproduce it. But if your app is at scale, with >1M users and hundreds of user flows, this approach breaks down. We'll explore how to profile JavaScript in production and how it can help us better understand performance.
