# [NY Web Performance Meetup: Several Components are Rendering: Client Performance at Slack-Scale](https://www.meetup.com/web-performance-ny/events/301319630/)

## 2024-08-13

Slack’s desktop application is like a duck. On the surface, everything has to appear effortless, but underneath, we're swimming furiously. We have to support hundreds of complex feature interactions and process a constant stream of input from user and server alike, all without breaking a sweat.

Join Jenna Zeigen, former Senior Staff Engineer and founding member of Slack's frontend performance team, as we dive in and explore the performance bottlenecks we’re encountering as the application and team continue to grow and evolve.

We'll dig into how foundational architectural decisions have rippled to create these issues and the wide range of technical and cultural approaches our team is taking to prevent and mitigate the inefficiencies that cause your laptop fans to spin wildly.
