# [NY Web Performance Meetup: Behind the scenes of the world's highest-converting checkout](https://www.meetup.com/web-performance-ny/events/301343492/)

## 2024-09-12

Checkout is the heart of e-commerce. This is where a visitor becomes a buyer, the money changes hands, and a shopping cart transforms into an order.

No wonder that optimizing the checkout experience can feel like performing heart surgery! In this talk, we will dive into the anatomy of a modern online checkout, deconstruct its key components, and uncover speed traps.

We'll talk about the philosophy behind different checkout options, and how to find a balance between allowing customization and keeping the checkout fast. We will also learn how to optimize checkout experience to increase conversion, which means - of course - making more money!
