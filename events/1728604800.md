Interaction to Next Paint (INP), Google's new Core Web Vitals, can be a challenge. Worldwide, the percentage of CWV rates who passed dropped by about 10%. So, how do you improve it? Why should you even care? And better yet, can you finally pinpoint what exact third party is causing havoc? Yes. You can. Allow us to guide you through the awesome ways you can improve the responsiveness of your shop. There will be memes, there will be a quiz, and not only will you meet LoAF, you'll even love LoAF! Because, we all want a quick website, right?
