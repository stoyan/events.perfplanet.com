**performance.sync()** is a meet-up taking place on the evening before the [performance.now](http://performance.now)[() conference](https://perfnow.nl/). This year's meetup sponsor is [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/), and our theme will be **collaborating on performance**. If you have a topic that you would like to present, please share this with us by [completing this form](https://forms.gle/BZoBPk1BMATcWdCV9). Presentations are to run no more than 15 minutes as slots are limited, and we'll be in touch to let you know if you have been selected to present.
